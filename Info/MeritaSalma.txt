Hi Merita,
here are my findings:

Aldough site appears few years old, it's design is clean and simple, which I believe is easy to use and that's very important.

If your customers do not have any complaints ether, plus if it makes you money - than you don't need to worry to much.

Switching to new, up-to-date system is always good, but you gotta weigh in pros and cons.

It might be pricey and once you get it working you might not see any benefit (money-wise).

But if you do make enough money now, it is good to invest and parallely build better system.

As for the current work:

I am a co-founder of a small software company, so we have plenty of knowledge in the industry and do with various clients (big and small).

The goal is to adopt to a client and to make him satisfied with both product and price, so that's what I'm going for here :)
The hourly rate is $25 and here is how is broken down:
1 - Setting up code locally - 2h (this is most important part, if I cannot set it up locally, then there will be no charge but unfortunately also means we cannot do any work)

This also includes backing up your original code for safe keeping in case something goes wrong

(in case this is done, we can track changes easy, plus any future work won't use additional time)

2 - Implementing additional options for Main image (delete, resize, rotate) - 2h

3 - Implementing additional options for other images (resize, rotate) - 2h
4 - Shop for gifts - is this going to be a section like 'Shop by Category' but only display gifts? - if yes that would take 1h

5 - Newest goods on craftelia - assuming this would display new items (for example automatically show items that are added in last 7days or whatever we decide) - 1h

6 - All categories make with photo limit for example 9 pcs. - best thing here would be to implement a paging this would certainly speed up loading plus it would look nicer - and it would need at least an 1hour per grid,

but make it an hour, so Featured product 1h; Show for gifts - 1h; Newest goods on craftelia - 1h = 3h (but lets make it 2h)
Summary:

items: 1-3: 6h x $25 = $150

items: 4-6: 4h

I checked changes.I like it.
Only featured product section not working properly.
This section show latest products but not featured.
I would like that I can make in my admin role the best products for featured product and 
when customer see my page their can see in featured section only the most appealing product.
I choose 9 the best products for featured but website don't show in this section.
How much You will ask money for this issue fixing?
